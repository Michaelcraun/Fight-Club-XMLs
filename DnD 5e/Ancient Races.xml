		<name>Breath Weapon</name>
		<text>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy, according to your dragon type. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 6th level, 5d6 at 11th level, and 6d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest. Refer to the Dragon Type chart for more information. </text>

		<text>The blood coursing through your veins is set aflame at the smallest slight. When you take one full hit die's damage or more from a single attack, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, you enter a rage-like state. While in this state, you must spend your turn in combat attacking the nearest creature, friend or foe, with full force, gaining a bonus to your attack and damage rolls equal to your level divided by 5 (rounded up). At the end of each round spent in this state, you may choose to make another Wisdom saving throw, with a DC equal to 15 + the number of rounds spent in the state, to exit it. You continue attacking until you are successful on this saving throw, there is no longer a valid target, or you are reduced to 0 hp or fewer, whichever comes first. </text>
